**Summary:** A corporate video platform that served hundreds of daily users was redesigned. We increased the users visits, time on screen and suggestions clicks rate. Besides we reduced the findability issues and customers complaints.

# 1. Creative Strategy Brief

I had some interviews with the Technical Support Department about the main issues and users profiles. Then a stakeholders review, so we could agree on the following points:

## Why this project

<figure>

  <figcaption>Homepage screenshot (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

This semiconductors company, produces lots of training and promotional videos for trendy products. Storage, classification and reproduction were suported by a legacy platform called "Video Vault".

</figure>

It daily served hundreds of engineers, who struggled to find technical reviews and demos about our products used into their projects. So redesigning this platform meant an increase on users and bring customers into our funnel.

## Audience

### Electronics Engineers

They need quick answers about design constraints and features enablement. So they watch product tests videos to jump to specific cases and explanations as well as following tutorials or highlights on certain products as part of benchmarking.

When using the platform, they normally are at:

- The laboratory, in a test bench with the equipment connected. At the middle of an issue to solve.
- Own desk, working on a Bill of materials or supply catalogs.

## Business goals

- Redesign the findability so customers could get to the correct video, increasing the time on page.
- Give accurate suggestions, reflected on a higher click rate in the suggestions section. Also higher bounce rate in transitory pages.

## Team & responsibilities

This was a 2 months project that implied collaboration with: React Developers, IT Department and a Video SME. I followed this methodology:

**React Developer:** He was in charge of the front-end. UI, interaction and functionality development.

**IT Department:** They contributed with all the setup for the new web application into our corporate website.

**Video Expert (SME):** He was my primary contact to the video technology -brightcove- implemented into our servers.

**Me, as UX/UI Designer:** I designed the new UI and defined the interaction for all the new platform. Besides I provided some markup and styles for the new components.

**Our Digital Experience Manager:** At Austin, but traveling often to Guadalajara. He managed UX/UI, web development and content publishing teams. So he was the final approver of the project.

## Constraints

- Re-build the platform using our new development stack based on React.
- Changes in our video technology framework were out of discussion.
- We should offer something visually similar to the _"YouTube experience"_.
- Features around personalization were out of the scope.
- 4 sprints (2 months) to release. Besides the team would work on 2 or more projects at the same time.

# 2. Benchmark Research

## Analyzing video experiences

  <figcaption>UI, Interactions and Findability were analized over the top platforms</figcaption>
</figure>

During the first sprint, I analized several video platforms. I looked for trendy features, acostumed interactions and journeys. These are some of the insights:

- **Personalized suggestions were key on engagement and consumption.** We had to produce a similar effect without involving profile information due to legal constraints by the time.
- **UI focused on content preview.** We were limited by technology to offer "hover autoplay". But there are other ways to communicate users about the video's content.
- **Short search journey.** Based on two steps: Type some keywords, pick a category or channel. We had to exploit our video labels implementation. It was hidden in navigation and UI.
- **Popular content highlighted based on time.** Stakeholders had had problems with Marketing requests to highlight videos. Now we had the opportunity to define rules for hand-picked spaces, time sensitive and popularity.
- **Advertising spaces.** Suggested by stakeholders, sometimes we had to highlight business partners' content. We needed something not intrusive but complementary to the video content. [We all hate ads](https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/the-psychology-behind-why-people-dislike-ads).

# 3. UI Design

## Wireframes

I drew several options to arrange the information into spaces. Besides they helped to illustrate the user journey.

### Step 1: Homepage

- Global header and footer, plus the Hero App Banner were mandatory
- Left bar for categories navigation. Using the known product classification
- Using a search bar with basic error handling
- Clear content hierachy for hand-picked content to allow stakeholders to curate a premium space
- List of top seen videos (algorythm) in curated categories, with a label to display more items

</figure>

### Step 2: Search results

- Active filters section, above categories to display the modifiers of the list of results
- Results list with pagination and sorting options for time and popularity
- Result items as a thumbnail with name, description and metadata

</figure>

### Step 3: Video player page

- Video player with description and metadata
- Recommendations optional space at the right column
- Bottom section for promotion of partners' content

## Mid-fidelity Mockups

After some design feedback, I prepared several options in mid-fidelity mockups to discuss with stakeholders the best solution.

### Design Tradeoffs

- **Primary action over variety of options.** Stakeholders wanted spaces to fill according their different agendas. But we couldn't design something to allow dozen of minimal updates, we needed the algorythm. So I advocated for having 3 categories which could be updated with analytics data to reflect popularity and time sensitive content.
- **We're not YouTube.** Our users don't come to watch trends or latest product's news to this hidden platform. They come with a problem to solve. Besides they might not be familiar with our product's classification. So I added a section with lists of applications per industry segments so people could find content related to their job.
- **Less clicks doesn't mean intuitive design.** I added the "View all" label to show more items on demand. Once clicked, it was a category filter applied into the search page. Then, people could refine their search in the list view, instead of scanning dozens of thumbnails at the homepage.

# 4. Development

## UI Code Documentation

By the time I was also <a href="/creating-a-new-design-system" target="_blank">working on building our design system</a>. So I created a [demo page]() as placeholder to document the code.

This project was finished by August 2019. The current site is live at: [Videos—Solve problems and stay informed with quick how-to and demo videos](https://www.nxp.com/design/training/videos:VIDEO-VAULT#/)

## Lessons from leading this project

I was very limited by the video technology. We had an old implementation contracted with a popular video services provider. So I had to remove some features on the player and search. Constant communication with the SME was critical.

Having a clear plan from the beginning helped keeping design, code, tests on time for the release.
