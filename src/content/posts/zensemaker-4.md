Sure, personas are not accurate. And they could be a waste of time when over-designed. But that’s not the point. They are research artifacts to **show customers context and needs to facilitate communication** among teams.

[Using personas](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/) help teams to:

- **Be focused** on real needs according certain customer journeys.
- **Have open discussions** in terms of a third person’s goals. “Does this design meet the persona needs?” sounds more productive than “Can we make this bigger?” or “Will this provide more conversions?”.
- **Prioritize delivery** so you can test, verify and rethink solutions, instead of wasting time on polishing features before the release.

Remember, you’re not designing for an imaginary friend. **You design to deliver verified solutions to customer problems.** That’s why customers buy your product, they don’t care about the company or team’s methodologies.
