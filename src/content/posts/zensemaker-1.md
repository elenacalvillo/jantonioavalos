> [The best way to learn](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/#:~:text=Students%20who%20spend%20time%20teaching,retain%20what%20they've%20learned.) is teaching. So share while you learn. You must stop collecting and start connecting knowledge. That will feed your creativity, produce original content, and help more beginners.

You can create your own system, instead of [worrying about physical or digital notes, flashcards and spaced repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUndnWBR0A0).

**[Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/antonio52) imports your notes from Kindle, notebooks [and many mobile apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhpY1frNqdA)**. It schedules email reviews of your highlights and notes. Besides, it exports them to Notion and other formats.
