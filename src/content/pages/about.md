### Starting my career before college

  <!-- ![]( "") -->

I was 18 years old when I earned my technical degree in electronics and communications. That allowed me to win a half-scholarship at Computer Systems Engineering on one of the top Mexican Universities. Besides getting my first job as technician at the same time.

During college, I co-founded a non-profit (InRed AC) as director of projects and I was broadcaster of our radio show, interviewing local politicians, health professionals and educators. The mission, educate young people to be better citizens and better humans.

### Combining social activism with professional development

Later, I was nominated to the state young people award. I didn't win but I was invited to the first council of young people of the state. I collaborated with other young leaders giving advice to the governor and we updated the State's Law to enable young people access to better public services.

At my senior year at software engineering, I applied and was accepted two years in a row for internships at Intel. I worked in validation and then design teams. My role was critical to the team's collaboration. I wrote 80+ articles of debugging best practices and created a Knowledge Management System which changed the way my team shared information.

I was always doing research and testing with users, because I cared about doing people's jobs easier instead of just adding another tool. So I met UX Design and I push my career into it.

I took a sabbatical half year at the beach. I learned web development and UI design. So I got my first job as web developer at NXP Semiconductors. I ().

I led the creation of the new search experience. I coordinated developers, designers and business people. I also did industry benchmarking and created low-fidelity prototypes. Then, I was promoted to UX Design Lead. I kept working on translating business needs into scoped technical requirements, doing research, prototyping and testing so coodinaring the development as well.

The 2020 was even more hard after being part of the laid offs. But I decided to invest my time and savings in leveling up my skills. So I worked on my UX Certification with Nielsen Norman Group. Besides I started writing, I worked to get curated by Medium, and now I write on UX Collective. and recently co-authored an O'Reilly book.

I'm building this website as portfolio and getting the habit of public learning: sharing takeaways.

So, what's your story?
