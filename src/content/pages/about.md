I'm Juan Antonio, an engineer in UX living at Guadalajara. Since I was little I always wanted to open my toys to see how they worked, even sometimes they wouldn't work again...

That's why when I grew up I studied a technologist degree in electronics, so I could build my own devices. But the more I created projects the more I liked programming -the soul of my inventions. So at university, I went for computer systems engineering.

I started working in the tech industry since I began college. It helped me to realize how the real world was and squeeze my teacher's experience. It was in the middle of this environment that I ran into the question "Does this software really people's work easier or it complicates more their life?".

After much thought, it was while creating a desktop app when I discovered a UX design online course, and I fell in love with it. Because I understood it wasn't device building or software programming but self-learning and strategic problem-solving what really filled me. And, what is more complex than finding a person's real problem and building a multidisciplinary team solution that can even improve his or her talents?!

Today, in the middle of coffee and books at my desk, I continue working in the hardware industry but I've been focusing my career on product design and UX engineering so I can become a UX Architect, who lead the transformation of people's needs into well-designed solutions.

So, that's my story. What's yours? Contact me and I hope we can meet soon at any social activity on technology and design. Or even more interesting, at a new project proposal.
